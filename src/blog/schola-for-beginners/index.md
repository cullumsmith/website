Do you aspire to join the schola at your parish? Or perhaps you've been asked
to assemble a schola at your chapel so that you can have Sung Masses?
This guide is for you!

This page contains everything I wish I knew when I first began chanting for the
traditional Mass. It's not an exhaustive reference, but it will teach you the
jargon needed to get your feet off the ground.

This is a work in progress. Please [email me](mailto:"Cullum Smith" <cullum@sacredheartsc.com>)
with any corrections or suggestions.

## Target Audience

This guide assumes that you have a general familiarity with the traditional Mass
and liturgical calendar.

It also assumes that you have some existing musical skill. You should be familiar
with rhythm, standard music notation, solfège, etc. Ideally, you have experience
singing with choirs or playing a musical instrument.

I don't mean to say that modern music skills are *required* to learn chant—sometimes
it can actually be a stumbling block! But since most people come to the
schola with some prior music experience, that's who I'll be writing for.
